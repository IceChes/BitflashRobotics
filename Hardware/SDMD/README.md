# Software Defined Motor Driver
Not technically deprecated until Snap driver is done.

An actually good brushed DESC that you can reprogram in the Arduino IDE. SDMD will shut down if the outputs are short circuited. This version of SDMD is fully working and can be sent out for fab and used with the sdmd.ino.hex machine code in the FW folder.
