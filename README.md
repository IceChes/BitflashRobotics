# ReprogramRobotics
This repository contains the raw firmware for my combat robots, as well as CAD and information about the ones that I've designed.

# Firmware Folder
Contains as-is firmware files. You should be able to work with Arduino directly in here. There are also compiled firmware files in here. If you want documentation for non-prototype firmware, that's also in here. All firmware, unless noted otherwise, is GPL3 licensed.

# Hardware Folder
Non-robot pieces of hardware, including Kicad workspaces, pieces of universal hardware (of which this ecosystem has few), and transmitter versions. All hardware, unless noted otherwise, is under the OHL-W license.

# Robot CAD Folder
Robot CAD and fab files, occasionally including build instructions and BOMs. All robots are of original design and licensed under OHL-W.
