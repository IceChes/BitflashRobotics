# Boing!
| Name | Class | Status |

|Boing!      |Antweight       |2-2        |

Boing is my first full combat robot, named for its bouncy wheelguards. It's got a small spinner and a relatively wide body and is designed to be noncompetitive. 

Notes: The wheel guards can also be made of 175x25 strips of UHMW. The weapon arm should be cut from 7075 and the weapon from AR500 steel. The lid is slightly too thin and tends to break around the screws in combat.
