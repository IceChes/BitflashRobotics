# CAD
In here you will find STEP assemblies of all robots as well as fab files such as STLs and DXFs. Manually created parts may have a PDF drawing and a STEP file. For working, finished robots there will also be a BOM and assembly guide. If you wish to iterate on any of my robots, this is where you can do that. Beware, some of these files are messy.

If you are seeking to just assemble a bot, the documentation in each bot's README should suffice.
