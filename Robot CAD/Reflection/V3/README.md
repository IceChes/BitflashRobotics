# Reflection V3
Designed to solve most of the problems of V2. Drives and hits well but still needs work. I don't recommend building V3 but if you do, build 3.1 instead. It's just better.

# Assembly (v3)
1. Use 4x M3x6 bolts and nuts to secure 2x top motor mounts to the mounts on the lid.
2. Tap the bottom corner hole in the uprights to accept an M4 bolt. 
3. Bolt uprights in place using 4x M5x10 bolts and nuts. The bolt face should be inside the chassis.
4. Bolt side armor pieces in place using 4x M5x10 bolts and nuts. The bolt face should be inside the armor piece.
5. Bolt magdock into bottom of chassis using 2x M3x6 bolts and nuts.
6. Stack up the weapon, weapon hub, and washer. Thread 4x M3x10 bolts through the holes and secure the assembly with 4 M3 nuts.
7. Assemble wiring harness, including all motors and XT30 connector. Leave FT switch loose.
8. Slip motors into the L and R mounts, then press the mounts into the slots in the chassis.
9. Slide weapon assembly onto 2207 motor shaft. Secure with the motor's included lock nut.
10. Bolt 2207 to the left upright (left when viewed from the back) using 4x M3x10 bolts.
11. Press MF105ZZ bearing into the right upright, supporting the end of the 2207.
12. Use 8x M3x6 bolts and nuts to secure both titanium armor plates to the front of the chassis.
13. Connect connect battery to robot. Now that you have a good idea of how everything sits in the bot, find a free space for your FT switch and super glue it there. Unplug battery.
14. Attach wheel hub body to motor shafts, slide tire on, then attach outside of hub body.
15. Secure lid using 6x M3 plastite screws. The top motor mounts from the first step should clamp down on the motors, enclosing them safely.
16. Thread M4x10 bolt through fork and into upright. The bolt should bottom out on the chassis of the robot, allowing the fork to hinge. The hinging should be limited by the forward upright nut.
17. Repeat step 16 for the other fork.
18. Push sled into slot in the bottom of the uprights. Secure with a suitable adhesive.
19. Slide the magnets into the magdock, securing with a suitable adhesive.
